		<h1> 1D-Chess </h1>

		<p> 
			1d-chess is a new variant where you can play the beautiful game without all those gratuitous extra dimensions.
			You can test you skills and try to beat the all knowing chess AI. Luckily for you, you've got one major advantage:
			You're playing as white!
		</p>

		<h2> Rules </h2>
		
		<p> There are three pieces in 1d-chess: </p>

		<h3> King </h3>

		<p>  Can move one square in any direction. </p>

		<h3> Knight </h3>

		<p>  Can move 2 squares forward or backward. (jumping over any pieces in the way) </p>

		<h3> Rook </h3>

		<p>  Can move in a straight line in any direction. </p>

		<p>
			Win by checkmating the enemy king: This occurs when the enemy king is in check (under attack by one of your pieces) 
			and there are no legal moves for the opponent to get their king out of check
		</p>

		<p>
			Careful! A draw can occur if:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li> A player is <strong>not</strong> in check and there are no legal moves for them to play (Stalemate) </li>
			<li> The same board position is repeated 3 times in a game. (3 Fold Repetition) </li>
			<li> There are only kings left on the board, and it is impossible to checkmate the opponent (Insufficient Material) </li>
		</ul>
